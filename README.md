## Description
The Emergency Resource Management System (ERMS) is an information management tool that supports government agencies and municipalities in locating and activating resources after an emergency such as a natural disaster, hazardous material spill, act of terrorism, nuclear incident, or another catastrophic event. The system is used because such events require resources above and beyond the set of resources that would normally meet a municipalityâ€™s typical operational needs. Users of the system can add their own resources to the system, search for resources based on keywords or location, request available resources, track the status of resources, and record information about emergency incidences.
